    "In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be. Eg. 15,100,etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float – This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Eg. 2.75, 14.85 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example – 2+3j\n",

    "In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python –\n",
    "\n",
    "String:- In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.\n",
    "Eg. A = \"abhi\"\n",
    "\n",
    "List:- Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\n",
    "Eg. A = \\[1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple:-Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by tuple class.\n",
    "Eg. A = (1,2,3,\"abhi\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Boolean Data Types:- \n",
    "Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. It is denoted by the class bool."

    "1. Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n",

    "3. Integral Expressions: These are the kind of expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end.\n",
    "6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False. It basically specifies one or more conditions. For example, (10 == 9) is a condition if 10 is equal to 9. As we know it is not correct, so it will return False\n",
